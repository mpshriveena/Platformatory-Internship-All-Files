Task 16: Worker Architecture: How Workers Interact with Temporal

Worker Architecture

The worker architecture consistes of following elements.
    Worker Process:
        A Worker Process is external to the Temporal Service and runs your application code.
        It's responsible for polling Task Queues, executing Tasks, and communicating results back to the Temporal Service. What is a Worker Process?
    Worker Entity:
        A Worker Entity is an individual Worker within a Worker Process.
        Each Worker Entity listens to a specific Task Queue and can contain both a Workflow Worker and an Activity Worker. What is a Worker Entity?
    Task Queues:
        Task Queues are the mechanism through which Workers receive work from the Temporal Service.
        Multiple Workers can listen to the same Task Queue for load balancing and scalability. Background Terminology
    Tasks:
        Tasks are the units of work that Workers process. They can be Workflow Tasks, Activity Tasks, or Nexus Tasks.
        Each Task contains the context needed for a Worker to make progress on a Workflow or Activity Execution. What is a Task?
    Interaction with Temporal Service:
        Workers maintain a long-polling connection to the Temporal Service.
        They receive Tasks, execute them, and send results or Commands back to the Service. The SDK and Temporal Service relationship Part 2
    Scalability:
        You can run multiple Worker Processes, each potentially containing multiple Worker Entities.
        This allows for better throughput, availability, and resource utilization. What does the component topology look like?
    Workflow and Activity Registration:
        Workers must register the Workflow Types and Activity Types they can execute.
        All Workers polling the same Task Queue should be registered with the same types. How to run Worker Processes

How Workers Interact with Temporal

    Task Queue Polling: Workers poll task queues for tasks that need to be executed (either activities or workflows).
    Task Execution: Once a task is retrieved from the task queue, the worker executes the corresponding activity or workflow code.
    Temporal Server Interaction: Workers interact with the Temporal server to register workflows, poll task queues, report task completion, and handle retries.
    Worker Configuration: Workers can be configured to handle multiple task queues and tasks concurrently, making it possible to scale horizontally.
