Task 14: Activity Workers: How Workers Execute Activities

How workers execute activities:

Polling for Tasks
Activity workers are responsible for polling the Temporal service to get tasks (activities) from 
the task queue. The task queue is where Temporal stores activities that need to be executed. 
When a workflow schedules an activity, it is assigned to a specific task queue, and activity 
workers that are listening to that queue will pick it up.

Executing the Activity
Once an activity worker receives a task, it executes the corresponding activity function. 
Activities are defined using Python functions (or other supported languages), and the worker 
executes these functions when they are scheduled.
