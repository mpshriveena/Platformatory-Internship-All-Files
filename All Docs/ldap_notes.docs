                                            LDAP

AD

* AD stands for Active Directory
* Used to provide authentication, group and user management.

LDAP

* LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
* LDAP is a mature, flexible, and well supported standards-based mechanism for interacting with directory servers. 
* Itâ€™s often used for authentication and storing information about users, groups, and applications
* An LDAP directory server is a fairly general-purpose data store.
* It is very lightweight and so much secure
* It is used to manage and access the directory services
* It runs over TCP and IP protocol
* It is open and cross platform

LDAP vs AD

* LDAP is a way of speaking to Active Directory and Active Directory is a directory services database.

How LDAP works?

* LDAP follows client-server model


            1                      2                  3
    LDAP ready system ------->   LDAP  ------->      LDAP
      / Application             server <-------    Database
      (Client side)

1) That requests data from the associate LDAP database
2) Once we enter the credentials, it goes to LDAP server
3) LDAP server is associated with LDAP database so it will go and try to authenticate.
4) After that, it gives the response.

What happens actually?

* For example, there is a user,
* This user is currently holding user ID and password
* When we enter user id and password from the client side, it will go to the LDAP server.
* After that, LDAP server will talk to the LDAP database and it will verify if the user is valid or not

How does LDAP authentication between client and server work?

* From client side, we enter username and password
* After that it will go to our services or API
* After that, it will call the LDAP server.
* LDAP server then talks to the database, and once the database found that user is not authenticated, it will send the respobse back that the user is not valid.
* In case that credentials matches, it will authorize them and gives access to the services.

Why we need LDAP?

* Big companies
* Many roles, sub groups
* Write or update once and read multiple times.

LDAP Structure

* Follows tree hierarchy

                                           root
                                            |
                                            |
                                            V
                                        dc=example
                                    (domain component)
                                            |
                                            |
                                --------------------------
                                |                        |
                                V                        V
                             ou=user                  ou=group
                                |
                                V
                             cn=john

* root will always be the top one
* dc is top of the tree
* use DNS to define namespace
* ou stands for organization unit
* next is cn which stands for common name.
* cn contains the name of users
* one user can belong to multiple groups
* For that, we have to give attribute name

Types of authentication

* Simple
* SASL
