Task 48: Replay Workflows – Debugging with History

Why Replay Workflows?
Replaying workflows is essential for debugging and verifying the exact sequence of events that occurred in a workflow's execution. Temporal stores the full history of workflow executions, including all activities, decisions, and events. By replaying a workflow, you can observe how it would behave again based on past events, which helps identify issues or unexpected behavior.
Replaying workflows can help with:
    Bug diagnosis: Understanding why a workflow failed or didn’t behave as expected.
    Test validation: Verifying that changes to the workflow logic or Temporal configurations didn’t introduce new errors.
    Reproducing issues: Testing workflows under specific conditions to reproduce failures for troubleshooting.
    Efficient Debugging: You don’t need to manually recreate failed scenarios. Simply replay the workflow to understand the exact sequence of events.
    Deterministic Execution: Temporal ensures that replays are deterministic, meaning they will follow the exact same path as the original workflow.
    Faster Issue Resolution: Replay allows you to quickly find the root cause of an issue, saving both time and resources during the debugging process.

Replaying workflows cannot be implemented with Temporal CLI. It can be only implemented using client code
