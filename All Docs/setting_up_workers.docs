Setting Up Workers: Configuration and Best Practices

Setting up workers:
import asyncio
from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.worker import Worker
from workflow import GreetSomeone
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233", namespace="default")
    # Run the worker
    worker = Worker(client, task_queue="greeting-tasks", workflows=[GreetSomeone])
    await worker.run()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

Best Practices for Worker Configuration
To ensure the optimal performance of your workers, consider the following best practices:
    -->Use of Separate Workers for Different Task Queues
    -->Configure Timeouts
    -->Retries for Fault Tolerance
    -->Scale Dynamically
    -->Graceful Shutdown
